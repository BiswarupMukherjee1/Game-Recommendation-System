# Game-Recommendation-System
Recommend Video Games to users based on their personal interests and choices and gaming habits.

We have used 2 datasets in this project:
1. steam-200k.csv - https://www.kaggle.com/tamber/steam-video-games

  We use steam-200k.csv dataset as our primary dataset for collaborative filtering recommender system. Steam is the world's most popular PC Gaming hub, with over 6,000 games and a   community of millions of gamers. With a massive collection that includes everything from AAA blockbusters to small indie titles, great discovery tools are a highly valuable     
  asset for Steam.  This dataset is generated entirely from public Steam data. This dataset is publicly available in kaggle.


3. steam_games.csv - https://www.kaggle.com/trolukovich/steam-games-complete-dataset/version/1

  We will use another dataset called steam_games.csv. This dataset contains more than 40k games from steam shop with detailed data.
 
 
 ## Objectives
  1. Exploration and Analysis of steam-200k.csv and steam_games.csv dataset.
  2. Create rating using Expectation Maximization algorithm
  3. Generate recommendations using collaborative filtering algorithm: SVD Algorithm & SVD with Gradient Descent.
  
  
  
  ### Note:
    The objectives are limited to what has been done till date. We have used R language to do this project. We plan to include Content based recommender system and ALS      
    collaborative   filtering recommender in future.
